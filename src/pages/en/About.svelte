            Hello, I am Greg. I've been learning to code for almost 4 years now. Sadly I don't have any significant prior experience with web development,
            but, hopefully this will change now.

            One thing I enjoyed the most during the interview, I think for me was the whole vibe of the interview. It was like discussing with friends over 
            something new that one of us saw. All the participants, including me ofc lol, were laid back and chill and I was very happy from the whole process.

            In 5 years I see myself in your team hopefully, still coding and mastering Astro and Svelte, cause hey, let's face it. This project isn't exactly 
            what you'd call the best of the best, but I am happy about it. Both astro and svelte are languages I have never used before, so being able to do 
            this site from scratch was hard but rewarding for me and honestly it makes me happy with the result. I know it ain't perfect, but that is why I 
            want to join your team. To make it perfect one day!
        </p>
